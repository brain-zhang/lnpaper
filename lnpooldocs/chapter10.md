In this work, we’ve put forth a new abstraction over capital obligations in the Lightning Network, which we call channel leases. Channel leases can be bought and sold on a Channel Liquidity Marketplace directly solving a series of bootrap- ping challenges the network faces, commonly referred to as: the inbound liquidity problem. To implement a Channel Lease Marketplace in a secure manner, we put forth the concept of the Shadowchain application framework which is of independent use. We then concretely construct Lightning Pool, the ﬁrst CLM implemented on top of the base Bitcoin blockchain. Lightning Pool allows those with idle capital to earn yield on their Bitcoin, and also allows those that need inbound to receive over the network to obtain a reliable source of incoming pay- ment bandwidth. The exigence of systems such as Lightning Pool creates new revenue sources for routing nodes on the network, and also creates a new form of yield bearing instrument for the greater Bitcoin ecosystem.
