In this paper we examine the core inbound liquidity bootstrapping  problem the Lightning Network faces, and frame it as a resource alloca- tion problem to be solved by the application of market design and auction theory. We present Lightning Pool, a non-custodial channel lease market- place, implemented as a sealed-bid frequent batched uniform clearing price auction which allows participants to buy and sell capital obligations on the network. We call these capital obligations channel leases. A channel lease can be viewed as a cross between a traditional Ô¨Åxed-income asset and an internet bandwidth peering agreement. Channel leases allow nodes on the network with idle capital to earn yield (based on a derived per-block interest rate) by selling channels to other agents in the marketplace. The duration of such contracts is enforced on-chain using Bitcoin Script. We construct Lightning Pool using a novel design for constructing overlay applications on top of Bitcoin: a shadow chain. Shadow chains allow users to remain in full custody of their funds at all times while also participat- ing in higher level applications that scale via an optimistic transaction  cut-through protocol.
